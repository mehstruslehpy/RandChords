# What this is:
A simple random chord generator, I am not an expert in music theory but 
the basic idea is that it picks one of 12 possible root notes, picks one 
of a handful of chord types, then generates a few random extra tones.

You don't have to use every chord from this, you don't have to use all of 
the notes it generates. This is just meant as a tool to experiment with.
