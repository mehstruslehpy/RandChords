A simple random chord generator, I am not an expert in music theory but 
the basic idea is that it picks one of 12 possible root notes, picks one 
of a handful of chord types, then generates a few random extra tones.

You don't have to use every chord from this, you don't have to use all of 
the notes it generates. This is just meant for inspirational guidelines out of 
random chords.

The most important thing is to have fun.
